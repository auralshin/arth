Perpetual DEX Architecture anchors the Protocols. Use this page to explain what the topic solves, how it behaves in live systems, and how to evaluate it with production metrics.

#### Why it matters
- Frame the real-world problems perpetual dex architecture addresses for protocol, trading, or tooling teams.
- Highlight signals, metrics, or models practitioners watch when working with perp, dex.
- Document integration risks, governance constraints, and user experience trade-offs tied to perpetual dex architecture.

#### Starter outline
1. Foundational concepts: vocabulary, math, and architecture choices behind perpetual dex architecture.
1. Implementation patterns and stack diagrams showing where it plugs into DeFi workflows.
1. Risk and observability checklist: what to monitor, how to measure success, and how to fail safely.

#### Research prompts
- What data sets or dashboards best reveal the health of perp, dex?
- How do unit economics or incentive loops change when perpetual dex architecture scales?
- Which edge cases have tripped up teams shipping perpetual dex architecture before?

#### Next steps for the draft
