### AMMs in Depth: Constant Product and Variants

AMMs in Depth: Constant Product and Variants anchors the Protocols. Use this page to explain what the topic solves, how it behaves in live systems, and how to evaluate it with production metrics. It also highlights constant product and variants so readers can connect theory to on-chain practice.

#### Why it matters
- Frame the real-world problems amms in depth addresses for protocol, trading, or tooling teams.
- Highlight signals, metrics, or models practitioners watch when working with amms, depth.
- Document integration risks, governance constraints, and user experience trade-offs tied to amms in depth.

#### Starter outline
1. Foundational concepts: vocabulary, math, and architecture choices behind amms in depth.
1. Implementation patterns and stack diagrams showing where it plugs into DeFi workflows.
1. Risk and observability checklist: what to monitor, how to measure success, and how to fail safely.

#### Research prompts
- What data sets or dashboards best reveal the health of amms, depth?
- How do unit economics or incentive loops change when amms in depth scales?
- Which edge cases have tripped up teams shipping amms in depth before?

#### Next steps for the draft
- Link to complementary primitives or strategies so readers can keep exploring.
- Add diagrams, equations, or pseudo-code once the narrative scaffolding is ready.
- Collect production anecdotes or post-mortems to keep the page grounded.

**Note:** Replace these scaffolding notes with full prose, diagrams, and data-backed examples when ready.
