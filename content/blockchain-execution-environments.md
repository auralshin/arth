### Blockchain Execution Environments

This module describes the major VM families and how their execution models affect protocol design, throughput,
and quant engineering concerns.

- [**EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)**](./blockchain-execution-environments/evm.md) — Gas metering, storage model, and composability patterns.
- [**Solana / SVM**](./blockchain-execution-environments/solana-svm.md) — Parallel execution, account locking, and throughput considerations.
- [**Move VM (Aptos, Sui)**](./blockchain-execution-environments/move-vm.md) — Resource-oriented programming and deterministic replay.
- [**Comparative benchmarks**](./blockchain-execution-environments/comparative-benchmarks.md) — Finality, throughput, developer ergonomics, and fee dynamics.
- [**Quant engineering considerations**](./blockchain-execution-environments/quant-engineering.md) — Deterministic RNG, simulation tooling, and latency modeling.
