### How to Navigate These Docs

> info **Metadata** Level: All | Prerequisites: None | Tags: [welcome, overview, navigation]

Welcome to the Arth knowledge hub. You can think of these docs as a city with different neighborhoods:

1. **Welcome / Start Here** – where you get your bearings, build intuition, and pick a path that matches your background.
2. **Deep Content Tracks** – sections like Building Blocks, Protocol Deep Dives, Quant & Math, Signals, Strategies, Simulation, Risk. These are the “chapters” you’ll keep coming back to.
3. **Reference & Tools** – glossaries, cheat sheets, indices, and practical guides that help you quickly look things up or turn ideas into something testable.

Use the sidebar to browse by topic, or the search bar to jump directly to what you care about (for example, type “RSI”, “impermanent loss”, or “Sharpe ratio”).

#### Recommended Reading Paths

You don’t have to read Arth from start to finish. Pick the path that feels closest to where you are now.

**If you’re new to DeFi**

You might have used a centralized exchange or heard about “yield farming”, but the details feel fuzzy.

* Start in the **Welcome / Start Here** section to get a big-picture view of what DeFi is and how people actually use it.
* Then move into **Building Blocks** to learn the core ingredients: tokens, swaps, AMMs, lending, stablecoins, oracles, perps.
* Along the way, look for short sidebars and callouts labelled with “risk” or “common mistakes” – they highlight ways people actually lose money.

Once that feels comfortable, you can:

* Visit **Signals & Indicators** to see how tools like RSI and moving averages work.
* Dip into the **Strategy Library** to see how people combine building blocks into simple strategies.

**If you’re already trading or active in DeFi**

You understand the basics and maybe run some strategies, but want more structure and better reasoning.

* Skim **Building Blocks** and **Protocol Deep Dives** to fill any gaps in how protocols work under the hood.
* Spend time in **Signals & Indicators** to see clearly defined indicators (with intuition, formulas, and examples).
* Use the **Strategy Library** for structured write-ups: what the idea is, how it’s tested, and what can go wrong.
* When you want to move from intuition to evidence, read **Simulation & Backtesting** to learn how to test ideas honestly.

**If you come from a math/quant background**

You’re comfortable with formulas and distributions and want to see how they map onto DeFi.

* Go straight to the **Quant & Math Toolkit** for probability, statistics, returns, volatility, risk measures, and optimization.
* Then connect those ideas to real markets in **Signals & Indicators** and the **Strategy Library**.
* Use **Simulation & Backtesting** to see how these concepts play out on historical and simulated data.

You can always jump back to **Building Blocks** if some DeFi-specific concept (like liquidations or AMMs) needs more intuition.

**If you care about protocol risk and system design**

You might be a protocol designer, risk reviewer, or someone who wants to understand failure modes.

* Read **Building Blocks** and **Protocol Deep Dives** to see how common designs are structured.
* Pair that with **Risk & Security** to see smart contract risk, oracle risk, leverage, and operational pitfalls.
* Browse **Case Studies** to see real or realistic examples of what goes wrong and why.

#### Tips for Finding Content Faster

You don’t have to remember where everything lives. A few simple habits help:

* **Use the search bar.**
  Type what you have in mind:

  * “RSI” to see how Relative Strength Index works and how it’s used in strategies.
  * “impermanent loss” to find AMM and LP explanations.
  * “Sharpe” to jump to risk and performance measures.

* **Browse by section when you’re exploring.**
  Use the sidebar when you’re in “browsing mode” and not looking for anything specific. Opening a section often reveals related topics you hadn’t thought to search for.

* **Use the reference pages as a hub.**

  * The **Glossary** is great when a term feels familiar but you can’t quite recall it.
  * The **Indicator Index** lists all signals and indicators in one place.
  * The **Formula Cheat Sheet** lists key formulas with links to the full explanations.

* **Follow “See also” links.**
  Most pages end with a short list of related topics. Use these to build your own path: from a simple idea like “moving averages” to richer ideas like “trend-following” or “backtesting”.

#### Staying Oriented While You Read

A few conventions are used throughout the docs to help you keep track of where you are:

* Each page starts with a rough **level** (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced) and **prerequisites**, so you can decide whether to read it now or bookmark it for later.
* Important assumptions and risks are called out explicitly, rather than buried in the middle.
* Longer topics have an overview page at the top of the section, which suggests an order for the subtopics.

If you ever feel lost, you can:

* Go back to the **Welcome / Start Here** section and pick a reading path.
* Use the search bar to jump straight to the term or formula you have in mind.
* Open the **Reference** section and use the indices to find the right page.

The aim is that you always know what you’re reading, why it matters, and where to go next—whether you’re just discovering DeFi or trying to sharpen an existing research or trading process.
