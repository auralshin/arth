### Reading Paths

> info **Metadata** Level: All | Prerequisites: None | Tags: [overview, reading-paths, learning-paths]

Different people arrive at Arth with very different backgrounds. Some are opening a DeFi wallet for the first time; others are already running strategies or reviewing protocol risk.

This page helps you choose a path through the docs that matches where you are now. You can follow one path end-to-end or jump between them as your needs change.

#### How to Use These Paths

Each path is:

* A **sequence of sections** (for example, “Start Here → Building Blocks → Signals & Indicators”), and
* A **reading style** (for example, “skim the math” or “focus on case studies”).

If a page feels too easy, skim it and move on. If a page feels too dense, bookmark it and come back when you've seen more examples.

You do not “unlock” anything by reading in a strict order. These paths are signposts, not rules.

#### Path 1: New to DeFi

Choose this if:

* You know what a cryptocurrency is but DeFi terms still feel slippery.
* You want intuition and examples before formulas.

**Suggested route**

1. **Welcome / Start Here**
   * How to Navigate
   * This page (Reading Paths)
   * Risk & Reality Check
2. **Start Here / DeFi Without Jargon**
   * A day in the life of a DeFi user
   * TradFi → DeFi mental models
   * Tokens, addresses, and balances
   * Common use cases (swap, lend, borrow, LP)
3. **Building Blocks**
   * Tokens 101
   * AMMs and impermanent loss (intuitive view)
   * Lending and borrowing
   * Stablecoins and oracles
   * Perpetual futures and liquidations
4. **Risk & Security (selected)**
   * Liquidation risk
   * Smart-contract and oracle risk
   * Slippage, gas, and fees

After this, you can:

* Visit **Signals & Indicators** to see tools like RSI, moving averages, and volatility in action.
* Dip into the **Strategy Library** for simple, story-driven write-ups.

Focus on feeling comfortable with the words, diagrams, and examples. You can always come back for the math later.

#### Path 2: Active Trader or DeFi User

Choose this if:

* You already use DeFi protocols but want more structure and better reasoning.
* You care about how to design, test, and manage strategies.

**Suggested route**

1. **Building Blocks** – read carefully where you feel unsure (AMMs, lending, perps, liquidations).
2. **Signals & Indicators** – moving averages, RSI, MACD, volatility, DeFi-specific signals.
3. **Strategy Library** – momentum, mean reversion, LP strategies, delta-neutral setups.
4. **Simulation & Backtesting** – honest backtests, metrics, scenario testing.
5. **Risk & Security** – backtest vs live, execution risks, MEV and slippage.

As you go, treat each strategy page as a template: copy the structure (assumptions, rules, metrics, risks), not the exact numbers.

#### Path 3: Quant / Researcher

Choose this if:

* You are comfortable with probability, statistics, or data analysis.
* You want to see clean definitions, formulas, and how they connect to DeFi.

**Suggested route**

1. **Quant & Math Toolkit** – probability, returns, Sharpe/Sortino, drawdown, optimization.
2. **Signals & Indicators** – formulas, liquidity/order-flow signals, on-chain features.
3. **Simulation & Backtesting** – event-driven engines, agent-based sims, parameter sweeps.
4. **Strategy Library** – treat strategies as case studies; check assumptions and metrics.
5. **Case Studies** – postmortems to see how models succeed/fail in the wild.

Use this path as a scaffold for a research notebook or internal playbook.

#### Path 4: Protocol Designer, Auditor, or Risk Reviewer

Choose this if:

* You think in terms of mechanisms, incentives, and failure modes.
* You care about how changes in design ripple through markets and users.

**Suggested route**

1. **Building Blocks** – AMMs, lending, stablecoins, liquidations, oracles.
2. **Protocol Deep Dives** – AMM flavors, lending architectures, perps, bridges.
3. **Risk & Security** – smart-contract risk, oracle/liquidity/leveraged risk, operational considerations.
4. **Case Studies** – incidents involving oracles, liquidity crises, design bugs.
5. **Quant & Math Toolkit (selected)** – risk and performance measures, stress testing.

This path helps you connect protocol choices to market behavior and user outcomes.

---

#### Path 5: Data, Tooling, and Engineering

Choose this if:

* You work on data pipelines, dashboards, or research infrastructure.
* You want to turn protocol and strategy ideas into reliable systems.

**Suggested route**

1. **Data & Tooling** – data sources, cleaning/resampling, event logs, pipelines.
2. **Simulation & Backtesting** – architecture, metrics, reporting, real-data integration.
3. **Quant & Math Toolkit (selected)** – returns, volatility, risk measures.
4. **Strategy Library** – read with an eye for data requirements and infra gaps.
5. **Contributing** – add your notebooks, tooling notes, or automation tips to the docs.

#### Mixing and Switching Paths

You are not locked into one path:

* Start in **New to DeFi** and gradually adopt **Active Trader** or **Quant**.
* Be a **Quant** but follow **Protocol Designer** when thinking about new mechanisms.
* Be on the **Data & Tooling** path while using the **Strategy Library** as test cases.

When in doubt:

* Start with the path that feels least intimidating.
* Use search or the Reference section when you stumble on a term.
* Return to this page whenever your goals change.
