### Advanced Topics

This module collects higher-level research topics that often require cross-disciplinary tooling: tokenomics, governance, systemic risk, and dynamic hedging.

- Tokenomics modeling: inflation schedules, supply sinks, staking ratios, and peg designs.
- Governance game theory: voting equilibria, bribery, and incentive design for protocol upgrade mechanisms.
- Risk management: collateral correlation matrices, CVaR, and stress-testing whole-protocol exposures.
- Yield aggregation: normalizing APYs across compounding conventions and multiple asset types.
- MEV arbitrage simulation: modeling searcher profitability distribution, and the impact of mitigation on user welfare.
- Dynamic hedging: delta-hedging with on-chain perps and options replication strategies.

#### Advanced Topics

- **Tokenomics Modeling:** inflation schedules, staking ratios, burn mechanics.
- **Governance Game Theory:** voting equilibria, incentive modeling.
- **Risk Management:** collateral correlation matrices, CVaR estimation, systemic stress testing.
- **Yield Aggregation:** APY normalization across protocols (APY ≈ IRR under compounding).
- **MEV Arbitrage Simulation:** Searcher profit distribution models.
- **Dynamic Hedging Strategies:** Options replication, delta hedging via perps, AMM impermanent loss hedge.
