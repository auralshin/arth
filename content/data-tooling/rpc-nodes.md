### RPC Nodes

RPC Nodes anchors the Data & Tooling track covering analytics infrastructure. Use this page to explain what the topic solves, how it behaves in live systems, and how to evaluate it with production metrics.

#### Why it matters
- Frame the real-world problems rpc nodes addresses for protocol, trading, or tooling teams.
- Highlight signals, metrics, or models practitioners watch when working with rpc, nodes.
- Document integration risks, governance constraints, and user experience trade-offs tied to rpc nodes.

#### Starter outline
1. Foundational concepts: vocabulary, math, and architecture choices behind rpc nodes.
1. Implementation patterns and stack diagrams showing where it plugs into DeFi workflows.
1. Risk and observability checklist: what to monitor, how to measure success, and how to fail safely.

#### Research prompts
- What data sets or dashboards best reveal the health of rpc, nodes?
- How do unit economics or incentive loops change when rpc nodes scales?
- Which edge cases have tripped up teams shipping rpc nodes before?

#### Next steps for the draft
- Link to complementary primitives or strategies so readers can keep exploring.
- Add diagrams, equations, or pseudo-code once the narrative scaffolding is ready.
- Collect production anecdotes or post-mortems to keep the page grounded.

**Note:** Replace these scaffolding notes with full prose, diagrams, and data-backed examples when ready.
