### Fees, Rebates, and Routing

Fees, Rebates, and Routing anchors the Microstructure. Use this page to explain what the topic solves, how it behaves in live systems, and how to evaluate it with production metrics.

#### Why it matters
- Frame the real-world problems fees, rebates, and routing addresses for protocol, trading, or tooling teams.
- Highlight signals, metrics, or models practitioners watch when working with fees, routing.
- Document integration risks, governance constraints, and user experience trade-offs tied to fees, rebates, and routing.

#### Starter outline
1. Foundational concepts: vocabulary, math, and architecture choices behind fees, rebates, and routing.
1. Implementation patterns and stack diagrams showing where it plugs into DeFi workflows.
1. Risk and observability checklist: what to monitor, how to measure success, and how to fail safely.

#### Research prompts
- What data sets or dashboards best reveal the health of fees, routing?
- How do unit economics or incentive loops change when fees, rebates, and routing scales?
- Which edge cases have tripped up teams shipping fees, rebates, and routing before?

#### Next steps for the draft
- Link to complementary primitives or strategies so readers can keep exploring.
- Add diagrams, equations, or pseudo-code once the narrative scaffolding is ready.
- Collect production anecdotes or post-mortems to keep the page grounded.

**Note:** Replace these scaffolding notes with full prose, diagrams, and data-backed examples when ready.
