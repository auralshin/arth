### Glossary: DeFi and Quant Terms (A–Z)

Glossary: DeFi and Quant Terms (A–Z) anchors the Reference library of formulas and definitions. Use this page to explain what the topic solves, how it behaves in live systems, and how to evaluate it with production metrics. It also highlights defi and quant terms (a–z) so readers can connect theory to on-chain practice.

#### Why it matters
- Frame the real-world problems glossary addresses for protocol, trading, or tooling teams.
- Highlight signals, metrics, or models practitioners watch when working with glossary.
- Document integration risks, governance constraints, and user experience trade-offs tied to glossary.

#### Starter outline
1. Foundational concepts: vocabulary, math, and architecture choices behind glossary.
1. Implementation patterns and stack diagrams showing where it plugs into DeFi workflows.
1. Risk and observability checklist: what to monitor, how to measure success, and how to fail safely.

#### Research prompts
- What data sets or dashboards best reveal the health of glossary?
- How do unit economics or incentive loops change when glossary scales?
- Which edge cases have tripped up teams shipping glossary before?

#### Next steps for the draft
- Link to complementary primitives or strategies so readers can keep exploring.
- Add diagrams, equations, or pseudo-code once the narrative scaffolding is ready.
- Collect production anecdotes or post-mortems to keep the page grounded.

**Note:** Replace these scaffolding notes with full prose, diagrams, and data-backed examples when ready.
