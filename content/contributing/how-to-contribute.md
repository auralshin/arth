### How to Contribute

How to Contribute anchors the Contributor Guide. Use this page to explain what the topic solves, how it behaves in live systems, and how to evaluate it with production metrics.

#### Why it matters
- Frame the real-world problems how to contribute addresses for protocol, trading, or tooling teams.
- Highlight signals, metrics, or models practitioners watch when working with how, contribute.
- Document integration risks, governance constraints, and user experience trade-offs tied to how to contribute.

#### Starter outline
1. Foundational concepts: vocabulary, math, and architecture choices behind how to contribute.
1. Implementation patterns and stack diagrams showing where it plugs into DeFi workflows.
1. Risk and observability checklist: what to monitor, how to measure success, and how to fail safely.

#### Research prompts
- What data sets or dashboards best reveal the health of how, contribute?
- How do unit economics or incentive loops change when how to contribute scales?
- Which edge cases have tripped up teams shipping how to contribute before?

#### Next steps for the draft
- Link to complementary primitives or strategies so readers can keep exploring.
- Add diagrams, equations, or pseudo-code once the narrative scaffolding is ready.
- Collect production anecdotes or post-mortems to keep the page grounded.

**Note:** Replace these scaffolding notes with full prose, diagrams, and data-backed examples when ready.
