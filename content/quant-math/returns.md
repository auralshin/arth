### Returns

Returns measure the relative change in value of an asset or portfolio over time. Simple returns compare end value to starting value over a period. Log returns take logarithms of price ratios, which makes aggregation over time additive at the cost of some interpretive complexity.

The choice between simple and log returns affects both statistical properties and intuition. Simple returns are more direct and align with realised profit or loss on a single trade. Log returns are convenient for modelling and compounding, especially when analysing many periods and processes with multiplicative structure.

In DeFi, returns apply not only to spot positions but also to LP shares, yield strategies, and leveraged structures. Properly defining the return of a position that involves collateral, borrowed funds, and rewards requires clear accounting of all cash flows and valuation points.
