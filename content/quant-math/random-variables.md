### Random Variables

Random variables attach numbers to uncertain events. Instead of talking about vague outcomes such as “price goes up” or “a liquidation happens”, a random variable represents these events numerically. Examples include the return of an asset over one day, the number of liquidations in a block, or the volume traded in a pool over an hour.

A random variable comes with a distribution that describes which values are likely and which are rare. Distributions can be discrete, continuous, or mixed, depending on whether the variable takes distinct values or ranges. Moments such as expectation and variance summarise key aspects of the distribution, and play a central role in risk and portfolio analysis.

Random variables provide the basic language for describing risk in DeFi. Returns, price jumps, liquidation counts, and funding payments can all be modelled this way, enabling formal reasoning about averages, variability, and tail behaviour rather than relying on isolated scenarios.
