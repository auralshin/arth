### Sharpe Ratio

> info **Metadata** Level: Intermediate | Prerequisites: Returns, Volatility | Tags: performance, sharpe, risk-adjusted-return

The Sharpe ratio measures excess return per unit of volatility. It compares the average return of a strategy above a reference rate, such as a risk free yield, to the standard deviation of those returns. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates higher average compensation for each unit of risk taken, as measured by volatility.

The metric assumes that volatility is a reasonable proxy for risk and that returns behave in a relatively stable manner over the sample period. Heavy tails, skew, and time-varying volatility can distort interpretation. A high Sharpe ratio over a short or favourable period does not guarantee robustness.

In DeFi, Sharpe ratios are often computed for LP strategies, yield farms, and perp trading systems. Interpreting these ratios responsibly involves checking sample length, drawdown history, and sensitivity to different measurement horizons.
