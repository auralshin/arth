### Position Sizing and Leverage

Position Sizing and Leverage anchors the Quant & Math Toolkit for research teams. Use this page to explain what the topic solves, how it behaves in live systems, and how to evaluate it with production metrics.

#### Why it matters
- Frame the real-world problems position sizing and leverage addresses for protocol, trading, or tooling teams.
- Highlight signals, metrics, or models practitioners watch when working with position, sizing.
- Document integration risks, governance constraints, and user experience trade-offs tied to position sizing and leverage.

#### Starter outline
1. Foundational concepts: vocabulary, math, and architecture choices behind position sizing and leverage.
1. Implementation patterns and stack diagrams showing where it plugs into DeFi workflows.
1. Risk and observability checklist: what to monitor, how to measure success, and how to fail safely.

#### Research prompts
- What data sets or dashboards best reveal the health of position, sizing?
- How do unit economics or incentive loops change when position sizing and leverage scales?
- Which edge cases have tripped up teams shipping position sizing and leverage before?

#### Next steps for the draft
- Link to complementary primitives or strategies so readers can keep exploring.
- Add diagrams, equations, or pseudo-code once the narrative scaffolding is ready.
- Collect production anecdotes or post-mortems to keep the page grounded.

**Note:** Replace these scaffolding notes with full prose, diagrams, and data-backed examples when ready.
