### Mean Reversion

Mean reversion describes processes that tend to move back toward a long run average or equilibrium level. After an extreme move, the process exhibits a tendency to drift back, rather than wandering away indefinitely as in a pure random walk.

Mathematical models of mean reversion include discrete time autoregressive processes and continuous time Ornstein Uhlenbeck dynamics. These models introduce a pull toward a central value, with strength determined by a reversion speed parameter. Noise still drives fluctuations, but large deviations are less persistent on average.

In DeFi markets, mean reversion ideas appear in pairs trading, funding rate normalisation, and some volatility strategies. Identifying when mean reversion is likely versus when trends dominate is an empirical question, and regime switching is common. Risk management for mean reverting strategies must account for the possibility of structural shifts where the effective mean changes.
