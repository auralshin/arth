### Covariance

> info **Metadata** Level: Intermediate | Prerequisites: Expectation & Variance | Tags: math, covariance, correlation, portfolios, dependence

Covariance measures how two random variables move together. Positive covariance indicates that high values of one variable tend to coincide with high values of the other, while negative covariance indicates opposite co-movements. Correlation is a normalised version of covariance that lies between minus one and plus one, making comparisons easier.

In portfolio terms, covariance describes how asset returns interact. Portfolio variance depends not only on individual volatilities but also on the covariances between assets. Low or negative covariance can reduce overall risk without necessarily sacrificing expected return.

For DeFi portfolios holding tokens, LP positions, and derivative exposures, covariance captures how these components respond to market moves together. Highly correlated positions behave like a single large bet, while less correlated components can provide diversification even within the same ecosystem.
