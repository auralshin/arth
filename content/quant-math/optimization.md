### Optimization

Optimization provides a framework for choosing decision variables to maximise or minimise an objective subject to constraints. In portfolio problems, the variables are typically asset weights or exposures, the objective involves expected return or utility, and constraints encode risk limits, leverage caps, or regulatory rules.

Many portfolio optimisation problems can be formulated as convex programs, where local optima are global and efficient algorithms exist. Others involve non convex constraints, integer decisions, or complex risk measures, requiring approximations or heuristics.

In DeFi contexts, optimization can apply to allocation across tokens, LP positions, and strategies; to selection of leverage levels; and to assignment of collateral across protocols. The quality of the outcome depends on how well the objective and constraints reflect the actual goals and frictions in the system, including gas costs, liquidity, and protocol specific risks.
