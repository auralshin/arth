### Expectation & Variance

> info **Metadata** Level: Intermediate | Prerequisites: Random Variables | Tags: math, expectation, variance, risk, dispersion

Expectation and variance are the basic numerical summaries of a random variable. Expectation captures the average value in the long run, while variance measures how widely outcomes tend to spread around that average. For a return distribution, the expectation relates to average growth, and the variance relates to typical fluctuation size.

Expectation is linear, which means the expectation of a sum is the sum of expectations. This property is the backbone of portfolio analysis, allowing total expected return to be expressed as a weighted combination of individual asset expectations. Variance is not linear, but it can still be decomposed into contributions from individual risks and their interactions, especially when covariance is introduced.

In DeFi, expectations and variances appear in performance evaluation, risk limits, and model calibration. Even when distributions are far from normal, these quantities provide a first-order view of central tendency and dispersion, and they feed into ratios such as Sharpe and Sortino.
