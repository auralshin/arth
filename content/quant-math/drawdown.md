### Drawdown

Drawdown measures declines from previous peaks in a portfolio or price series. Maximum drawdown is the largest peak to trough fall observed over a period. Unlike volatility, which treats upside and downside symmetrically, drawdown focuses on how bad things can get along the path, regardless of eventual recovery.

Drawdown is path dependent. Two return sequences with the same final result and volatility can have very different drawdown histories. Long periods of choppy sideways behaviour, repeated small losses, or sharp crashes can all produce significant drawdowns, with different psychological and practical implications.

In DeFi, drawdown matters for margin, liquidation risk, and operational resilience. Strategies that look attractive on average may still pass through drawdowns that exceed risk tolerance or collateral capacity. Monitoring drawdowns over multiple time scales helps align leverage and position sizing with realistic worst case paths.
