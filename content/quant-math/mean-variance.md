### Mean-Variance

Mean variance analysis models portfolios in terms of expected return and variance. Under this framework, an efficient portfolio is one that offers the highest expected return for a given level of variance, or equivalently the lowest variance for a given expected return.

The efficient frontier is the set of such portfolios. Points below this frontier are dominated by better combinations. When a risk free asset is available, combining it with efficient risky portfolios generates a straight capital allocation line in expected return and variance space.

In DeFi, mean variance tools can be applied to baskets of tokens, LP strategies, and derivatives, with expected returns and covariances estimated from historical data or scenarios. The classic framework does not capture all aspects of risk, such as skew, tail risk, or regime changes, but it provides a starting point for systematic allocation and highlights the role of diversification.
