### Case Study: A Failed DeFi Strategy and What Went Wrong

Case Study: A Failed DeFi Strategy and What Went Wrong anchors the Case Studies collection of real postmortems and playbooks. Use this page to explain what the topic solves, how it behaves in live systems, and how to evaluate it with production metrics. It also highlights a failed defi strategy and what went wrong so readers can connect theory to on-chain practice.

#### Why it matters
- Frame the real-world problems case study addresses for protocol, trading, or tooling teams.
- Highlight signals, metrics, or models practitioners watch when working with failed, strategy.
- Document integration risks, governance constraints, and user experience trade-offs tied to case study.

#### Starter outline
1. Foundational concepts: vocabulary, math, and architecture choices behind case study.
1. Implementation patterns and stack diagrams showing where it plugs into DeFi workflows.
1. Risk and observability checklist: what to monitor, how to measure success, and how to fail safely.

#### Research prompts
- What data sets or dashboards best reveal the health of failed, strategy?
- How do unit economics or incentive loops change when case study scales?
- Which edge cases have tripped up teams shipping case study before?

#### Next steps for the draft
- Link to complementary primitives or strategies so readers can keep exploring.
- Add diagrams, equations, or pseudo-code once the narrative scaffolding is ready.
- Collect production anecdotes or post-mortems to keep the page grounded.

**Note:** Replace these scaffolding notes with full prose, diagrams, and data-backed examples when ready.
