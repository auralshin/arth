### Stablecoins and Pegs

Stablecoins and Pegs anchors the Building Blocks track focused on core DeFi primitives. Use this page to explain what the topic solves, how it behaves in live systems, and how to evaluate it with production metrics.

#### Why it matters
- Frame the real-world problems stablecoins and pegs addresses for protocol, trading, or tooling teams.
- Highlight signals, metrics, or models practitioners watch when working with stablecoins.
- Document integration risks, governance constraints, and user experience trade-offs tied to stablecoins and pegs.

#### Starter outline
1. Foundational concepts: vocabulary, math, and architecture choices behind stablecoins and pegs.
1. Implementation patterns and stack diagrams showing where it plugs into DeFi workflows.
1. Risk and observability checklist: what to monitor, how to measure success, and how to fail safely.

#### Research prompts
- What data sets or dashboards best reveal the health of stablecoins?
- How do unit economics or incentive loops change when stablecoins and pegs scales?
- Which edge cases have tripped up teams shipping stablecoins and pegs before?

#### Next steps for the draft
- Link to complementary primitives or strategies so readers can keep exploring.
- Add diagrams, equations, or pseudo-code once the narrative scaffolding is ready.
- Collect production anecdotes or post-mortems to keep the page grounded.

**Note:** Replace these scaffolding notes with full prose, diagrams, and data-backed examples when ready.
