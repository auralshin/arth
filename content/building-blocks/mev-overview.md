### MEV, Sandwiches, and Other Dark Arts

MEV, Sandwiches, and Other Dark Arts anchors the Building Blocks track focused on core DeFi primitives. Use this page to explain what the topic solves, how it behaves in live systems, and how to evaluate it with production metrics.

#### Why it matters
- Frame the real-world problems mev, sandwiches, and other dark arts addresses for protocol, trading, or tooling teams.
- Highlight signals, metrics, or models practitioners watch when working with mev, overview.
- Document integration risks, governance constraints, and user experience trade-offs tied to mev, sandwiches, and other dark arts.

#### Starter outline
1. Foundational concepts: vocabulary, math, and architecture choices behind mev, sandwiches, and other dark arts.
1. Implementation patterns and stack diagrams showing where it plugs into DeFi workflows.
1. Risk and observability checklist: what to monitor, how to measure success, and how to fail safely.

#### Research prompts
- What data sets or dashboards best reveal the health of mev, overview?
- How do unit economics or incentive loops change when mev, sandwiches, and other dark arts scales?
- Which edge cases have tripped up teams shipping mev, sandwiches, and other dark arts before?

#### Next steps for the draft
- Link to complementary primitives or strategies so readers can keep exploring.
- Add diagrams, equations, or pseudo-code once the narrative scaffolding is ready.
- Collect production anecdotes or post-mortems to keep the page grounded.

**Note:** Replace these scaffolding notes with full prose, diagrams, and data-backed examples when ready.
