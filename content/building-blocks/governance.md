### Governance and Tokens with Power

Governance and Tokens with Power anchors the Building Blocks track focused on core DeFi primitives. Use this page to explain what the topic solves, how it behaves in live systems, and how to evaluate it with production metrics.

#### Why it matters
- Frame the real-world problems governance and tokens with power addresses for protocol, trading, or tooling teams.
- Highlight signals, metrics, or models practitioners watch when working with governance.
- Document integration risks, governance constraints, and user experience trade-offs tied to governance and tokens with power.

#### Starter outline
1. Foundational concepts: vocabulary, math, and architecture choices behind governance and tokens with power.
1. Implementation patterns and stack diagrams showing where it plugs into DeFi workflows.
1. Risk and observability checklist: what to monitor, how to measure success, and how to fail safely.

#### Research prompts
- What data sets or dashboards best reveal the health of governance?
- How do unit economics or incentive loops change when governance and tokens with power scales?
- Which edge cases have tripped up teams shipping governance and tokens with power before?

#### Next steps for the draft
- Link to complementary primitives or strategies so readers can keep exploring.
- Add diagrams, equations, or pseudo-code once the narrative scaffolding is ready.
- Collect production anecdotes or post-mortems to keep the page grounded.

**Note:** Replace these scaffolding notes with full prose, diagrams, and data-backed examples when ready.
